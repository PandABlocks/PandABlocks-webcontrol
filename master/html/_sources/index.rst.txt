Introduction
============

The PandABlocks-webcontrol package provides a webserver for a PandA. This
exposes a browser based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be used to:

- Inspect the available Functional Blocks present on the system
- Connect Blocks together
- Set and view Block parameters
- Save a Design consisting of a number of connected Blocks and their parameters
- Load a previously saved Design

The documentation has two starting points:

- The `Quick Start` gives a simple walkthrough on how to connect blocks together
- The `User Interface Overview` and onwards gives more in depth information
